This project demonstrates sentiment analysis (positive/negative) on text reviews using the Naive Bayes algorithm, implemented entirely from scratch in Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. No external machine learning libraries were used, providing a deep dive into the inner workings of Naive Bayes.


## üîç Key Features

* **From-Scratch Implementation:** Gain a thorough understanding of the Naive Bayes algorithm by building it step-by-step.
* **Detailed Comments:**  The code is heavily commented to explain the algorithm's logic, including concepts like likelihood smoothing.
* **Kaggle Dataset:**  The model is trained and evaluated on a pre-cleaned dataset from Kaggle.
* **Accuracy:** Achieves a respectable accuracy of 84% on the test set.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Dataset:** If you're interested in the dataset or want to run this notebook yourself, visit the Kaggle page and copy my notebook: [Click here!!](https://www.kaggle.com/code/b21dccn632nvquang/multinomial-naive-bayes-classifier)
2. **Environment:** Make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required libraries 
 3. **Run:** Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model.
## üí° How It Works

1.  **Data Loading:** Load the pre-cleaned dataset from Kaggle.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Convert text reviews into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words.
3.  **Naive Bayes Training:** Calculate class probabilities and conditional probabilities for each feature.
4.  **Prediction:** Classify new reviews as positive or negative based on the calculated probabilities.
## üìä Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy on a held-out test set, achieving 84% accuracy.

## üìñ Further Exploration

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different smoothing techniques (e.g., Laplace smoothing) or feature representations (e.g., TF-IDF) to potentially improve accuracy.
*   **Other Naive Bayes Variants:** Explore Bernoulli Naive Bayes for binary features or Gaussian Naive Bayes for continuous features, depending on the nature of your data.
*   **Deployment:** Consider deploying this model as a web service or API to provide real-time sentiment analysis capabilities.
*   **Error Analysis:** Analyze the types of errors the model makes to gain insights into its weaknesses and potential areas for improvement.
